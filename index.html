              <h3>About Daniel</h3>
                <p>Knows that you don't attempt to run up the stairs at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and you order your steak "wit". Daniel was drawn to design from a young age when he started drawing all over his older brothers' baseball cards and (what would be now) priceless comic books.</p>
                  <p>Daniel has a degree Graphic Design from the Art Institute of Philadelphia (go Eagles!)</p>
